## Transport Layer (TCP and UDP)

TCP
- TCP is a network protocol used by computers to communicate. 
- It is one of the fundamental protocals that makes the internet work.

UDP
- UDP is a network protocol used by computers to communicate. 
- One of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to work. 

UDP Advantages
- No connection needs to be established to send or receive data, so apps and operating systems work faster. 
- It endures packet loss, and will deliver data even if it is incomplete or contains an error. 
- Multicast Transmission: One UPD transmission can send data to multiple recipients. 

UDP Disadvantages
- Since it doesn't use a connection, transferring data is typically unreliable. 
- It has no error control, so it drops packets when errors are detected. 
- Multiple users accepting UDP data can cause congestion. 

TL;DR
- TCP calls you to say it's sending you a postcard, sends the postcard, then asks if you got it alright before hanging up the phone (resending, if necessary).
- UDP just sends you the postcard.
