## OSI Model ##

# NIC (Network Interface Controller)
- Also referred to as "Network Adapter", "LAN Adapter", and "Network Interface Card".
- NIC is the computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network. 
- Both a "Physical" layer and "Data Link" layer device. 
- This is because it provides physical access to a networking medium and, for IEEE 802 and similiar networks, provides a low-level addressing 
    system through the use of MAC addresses that are uniquely assigned to network interfaces.

# Information About The OSI Layer Model
- Each Layer is separate, and largely independent of the other layers. 

# The OSI Layer System

1. Physical Layer
- Consist of tools and resources that you can touch with your hands like cables and wires. 

2. Data Link Layer
- Responsible for reliable transmission of data frames between connected nodes. 
- Primarily consist of Media Access Control (MAC address) and Logical Link Control (LLC)

3. Network Layer
- Basically the IP Address Layer. 
- Interested in getting the traffic from the source to the destination. 

4. Transport Layer
- Transmits data using transmission protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- Ports also reside mainly in this layer.

5. Session Layer
- In layer 4, you determine which method of speaking is used, such as TCP or UDP, and layer 5 is where the conversation takes place. 
- The opening, closing, and managing of the conversation is achieved at layer 5. 

6. Presentation Layer
- In short, this layer has to do with file types. 
- Once the conversation in layer 5 is established, and a file is downloaded from the web server, that file type is how the data is presented to the computer.
- Examples include JPEG, MOV, PDF, and PNG. 

7. Application Layer
- Not to be confused with actual applications like Firefox and Google Chrome, we are talking about the protocols that the applications use.
- Think along the lines of what bridges the gap between the application and the network. 
    - You open a browser and what does it use? HTTP/HTTPS
    - You send an eMail from Outlook and what does it use? IMAP? POP3/SMTP?
