## OSI Model ##

There are seven layers to the OSI Model. These include the following:

In Descending Order:
    7. Application
    6. Presentation
    5. Session
    4. Transport
    3. Network 
    2. Data Link 
    1. Physical 

Layer 7: Application
- The layer in the OSI model that is closest to the end user. 
- It recieves information directly from the user and dsiplays incoming data to the user. 
- Ironically, applications themselves do not reside in the application layer. 
    - Instead, it facilitates communication through lower layers to establish connections with applications at the other end. 
- Web browsers, TelNet, and FTO are examples of communications that rely on layer 7. 

Layer 6: Presentation

Layer 5: Session 

Layer 4: Transport

Layer 3: Network 

Layer 2: Data Link

Layer 1: Physical
