## Mac Address ##

MAC Address stands for Media Access Control
- When doing ifconfig on Kali Linux, it is identified as the ether (below inet and inet6).
- MAC addresses are important because they are how we communicate over switches. They are also how you identify devices.
- We can think of it as the way that we communicate when using switches. 

If you were unsure about the host name or device name of a device, you can use the MAC Address and a MAC Address lookup to help identify the device.
