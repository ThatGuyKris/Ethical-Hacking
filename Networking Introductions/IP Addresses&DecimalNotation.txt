128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
 0  0  0  0  0 1 1 1 = 7.7.7.7
    - 7.7.7.7 is really 00000111.00000111.00000111.00000111
So, 192.168.1.1 is really 110000000.10101000.00000001.00000001

## IP Addresses ##

IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are layer 3 protocols. Layer 3 is a router. So, when we route traffic, we route via an IP address. 

# inet (IPv4)
- Syntax is in decimal notation.
- Most common used format today. 
- Made up of 32 bits, which equals four bytes.
    - 192.168.57.139 (Each section consist of 8 bits)
- IPv4 has been around for a long time, and has long since run out of addresses. There were over four billion addresses, and we have long since run out of ip address space.

# inet6 (IPv6) 
- Syntax is in hexadecimal notation.
- 128 bits
- IPv6 came from a necessity. There was a need for many more IP addresses, and now we have trillions.

# NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Anything that starts with 192.168 is a private IP Address that is only known to me. 

# Private IP Addresses
- Consist of classes A, B, and C.
- Class C 
    - What the most common household and small business use. 
    - If you see 192.168, you can guarantee that it is a private IP address.
    - This class is typically for smaller networks.
- Class B 
    - This class is typically for medium networks.
- Class A
    - This class is typically for large networks.
